Hi! I'm Joel from Singapore. I'm currently a 1st year undergrdaduate at Imperial College London reading Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Deeply fascinated by the impact of robotics and artificial intelligence, I hope to build a career in the field, striving to find my place in the intersection of mechanical, electrical and software engineering.

### My Journey in Engineering ###

I have a deep interest in designing and building both software, hardware and integrated projects. I see robotics as a marriage of disciplines in hardware and software, and strive to hone my skills in both areas. This website is dedicated to chronicling my endeavours!

**My Experience:**
1. Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
    - Language: Python (keras, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
    - What I've Done: 
        - Completed [_Deep Learning A-Z<sup>TM</sup>: Hands On Artificial Neural Networks_](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/) and [_Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python_](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/) courses on Udemy.
        - Competed in numerous [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/) competitions, building Random Forest Classifier and ANN models.
        - Co-wrote a paper on the potential application of Convolutional Neural Networks and Graph Theory to reduce habitat fragmentation. Shortlisted at the Singapore leg of the Microsoft Imagine Cup (Junior) 2020.
2. 3D Modeling and CAD + CAM (3-axis)
    - Software: Solidworks, Fusion 360, Ultimaker Cura, Blender
    - What I've Done: 
        - Designed, prototyped and machined small parts for robotic solutions as part of my internship with [Hope Technik](https://www.hopetechnik.com/).
        - Experience in FDM 3D Printing, Waterjet Cutting, NC Press Brake Machining and 3-axis CNC machining.
        - Designed and built a 3-axis CNC machine from scratch at home. Used CAD/CAM to design simple pieces to cut with the mill.
3. Cybersecurity
    - Software: Wireshark, Burpsuite, Hydra, Nmap, Metasploit
    - What I've Done:
        - Active in the CTF scene for over 3 years, with a consistent top 30% ranking (Stack the Flags, Cyberthon, WhiteHacks)
4. 2D Game Development
    - Software: Unity and C#
    - What I've Done:
        - Working on a Singaporean 2D RPG game. Still in progress!
