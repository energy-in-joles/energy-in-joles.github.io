# Overview

Stack the Flags 2022 was a 48-hour Capture-The-Flag (CTF) challenge from 2nd to 4th December 2022. After a hiatus from CTFs, it was difficult getting back into it. Nonetheless, 4 challenges completed, and a 23rd placing ain't too bad!

# PyRunner

### Description: Can you help us test our internal Python job runner prototype?

#### The Website ####

PyRunner is a web application that enables the user to input arguments into a templated uvicorn web server script. 

Filling in the argument boxes, it seems that the **title** field is appended to the output field when **Run Template** is clicked. Perhaps this can allow us to leak some kind of information?

![PyRunner Website](/assets/img/stf-22/pyrunner-website.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Looking at the script in the template box, we can see that this output behaviour is caused by a **print** function.

```python
print("Webserver: <title>")
```

This is interesting, as it seems that the user inputted title replaces a placeholder tag "<\title>" in the string. This seems like a fairly insecure way of adding user inputted string. Let's see how this replacement is done back end.

#### Snooping into the Source Folder ####

We are given the source folder for the problem. Let's take a look at that. We first note that there is a **fakeflag** file in the src folder. This is likely the same location as the real flag we need to leak from the machine. The file of interest here is **app.py**.

![app script 1](/assets/img/stf-22/app-script-1)

I am immediately drawn to the list called **disallowed** in line 13. Seems like a poorly cobbled up list of big "no-no" words to sanitise out of something. We also take a mental note from line 21 that the user inputs seem to be compiled into a list with the key value ***arguments***. Let's move on.

![app script 1a](/assets/img/stf-22/app-script-1a)

Looking at line 24, we see a **textfilter** function that applies the **disallowed** list of naughty words. The filter runs through the list using a for loop and replaces the "no-no" words as it goes along. Seems...sketchy.

Let's try to piece everything together and figure out how the **textfilter** comes into play, and what happens backend when we press the **Run Template** button on the site.

Bingo! We find the **Run Template** function in line 59:

![app script 2](/assets/img/stf-22/app-script-2)

In line 66 to 67, we see that the list of user arguments are looped through the textfilter, before replacing the **<{argument}>** tags that we saw earlier (ie <\title>).

#### Devicing a Solution ####

At the end of my recce, I note two key vulnerabilities:

1. Insecure Appendage of User Input to String
2. Weak Data Sanitisation of User Input

Our mode of attack seems clear, we will inject malicious input into the **title** field on the website to allow us to run OS code to read the flag in the machine.

Let's see how we can exploit 1 and 2 respectively:

##### Insecure Appendage of User Input to String #####

Since the app script does an in-place string replacement with the user input, we can simply close the string early with double quotes in our user input. 

Since we want to exploit the print function to leak the flag, we can then open an f-string to print the result of our OS function. Something like this:

~~~
"+f"{run my no-no code}
~~~

This way, when inject the code into the field, the code will read as:

```python
print("Webserver: "+f"{run my no-no code}")
```

#### Weak Data Sanitisation of User Input ####

In order to run an OS code, we need to **import** **OS**. Then, we can run a linux terminal code to fish out the flag. In one line, this can be written as:

~~~
__import__('os').system('cd && cat flag')
~~~

Of course, we used two big bad words here: **import** and **os**. Recalling that the **textfilter** uses a for loop an in-place replacement, we can mask words by sandwiching them between words checked later. 

Let's try "imp;ort". When **"import"** is being checked, it will not raise any alarm. Then, when ";" is checked, the system will remove the semicolon, leaving behind the word **"import"** unscathed. Nice!

However, we have a problem. **os** is the last word in the list, so we can't do the same thing for it. Well, no one said anything about **os** in capital letters. We can run it with capital letters then use the ```.lower()``` function to remove shrink it back to its original case.

Putting everything together, our payload looks like this:

~~~
"+f"{__imp;ort__('OS'.lower()).system('cd && cat flag')}
~~~

and when injected into the print function:

```python
print("Webserver: "+f"{__imp;ort__('OS'.lower()).system('cd && cat flag')}")
```

Let's give it a shot!

### Running the Payload ####

And it works!

Note that the flag I extracted here was not the competition file, as I am hosting the site for this writeup locally.
