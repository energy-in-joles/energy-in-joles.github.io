Hi! I'm Joel from Singapore. I'm currently a 2nd year undergraduate at Imperial College London reading Electronic and Information Engineering. Deeply fascinated by data, robotics and artificial intelligence, I hope to build a career in the field.

**My Experience:**
1. Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
    - Language: Python (Stable-Baselines3, pytorch, keras, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
    - What I've Done: 
        - Built and trained a physical Furuta Pendulum robot from scratch that can swing up and balances an inverted pendulum. Built using an Arduino Nano interfaced with a Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) Reinforcement Learning model with Stable-Baselines3.
        - Completed [_Deep Learning A-Z<sup>TM</sup>: Hands On Artificial Neural Networks_](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-and-machine-learning-with-python-hands-on/) and [_Machine Learning, Data Science and Deep Learning with Python_](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/) courses on Udemy.
        - Competed in numerous [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/) competitions, building Random Forest Classifier and ANN models.
        - Co-wrote a paper on the potential application of Convolutional Neural Networks and Graph Theory to reduce habitat fragmentation. Shortlisted at the Singapore leg of the Microsoft Imagine Cup (Junior) 2020.
2. 3D Modeling and CAD + CAM (3-axis)
    - Software: Solidworks, Fusion 360, Ultimaker Cura, Blender
    - What I've Done: 
        - Designed, prototyped and machined small parts for robotic solutions as part of my internship with [Hope Technik](https://www.hopetechnik.com/).
        - Experience in FDM 3D Printing, Waterjet Cutting, NC Press Brake Machining and 3-axis CNC machining.
        - Designed and built a 3-axis CNC machine from scratch at home. Used CAD/CAM to design simple pieces to cut with the mill.
3. Cybersecurity
    - Software: Wireshark, Burpsuite, Hydra, Nmap, Metasploit
    - What I've Done:
        - Active in the CTF scene for over 3 years, with a consistent top 30% ranking (Stack the Flags, Cyberthon, WhiteHacks)
