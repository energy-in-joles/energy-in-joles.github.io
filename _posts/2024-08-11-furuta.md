# Overview
A few months ago, I chanced upon a [video](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS2BTrx5T/) that demonstrated a commercial Furuta Pendulum design used to teach control theory at the University level. As someone who is always itching to try a new reinforcement learning (RL) project, this felt like the perfect challenge to apply RL to a hardware system I could build from scratch!

# What is it?
![explain](/assets/img/furuta/explain.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
A Furuta Pendulum is a control problem which involves a driven arm (free-rotating in the vertical plane) attached to a horizontal rotating plane. The goal of the robot is to balance the arm in the vertical position.
