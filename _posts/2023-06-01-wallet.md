So, My 3D printed [Smart Wallet](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3097272) broke :cry:.

I always appreciated that it integrated cards and coins in such a sleek and nifty way (boo to money clips @ridge). The design, however, was greatly limited by the pure FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) approach. Since I was interning at [Hope Technik](https://www.hopetechnik.com/), I was challenged to design and build a new mechanical wallet using the resources available. This provided me the ability to work with other production methods, namely DLP (Digital Light Processing or Resin Printing) and Waterjet sheet metal cutting. Exciting!

### Design Considerations ###

The original Smart Wallet had two compartments: a front compartment for coins, keys and receipts and a rear compartment for cards. The lid of the wallet could rotate to reveal the front compartment, while also pushing a lever that fanned the cards out of the rear compartment when opened. My wallet would emulate this, while resolving two major issues with the original design:
1. Rigidity Issues: the wallet was made of thin PLA layers that caused it to have reliability issues. It was also prone to cracking and warping.
2. Unusable Front Compartment: As the lid was weak and the compartment was too narrow, I was unable to use it to store cash or coins properly. This was a key issue I wanted to address.

### The Design: Mk1 ###

The design of the wallet saw many iterations, beginning with a sheet metal design. To combat the rigidty issues, I opted for stainless steel M3 fasteners, as opposed to press fitting the FDM parts together like in the original design.

Following the likes of The Ridge and Aviator, I also wanted to go with a pure sheet metal (aluminium) approach, coupled with a ball plunger locking mechanism. However, I found the design too heavy and cumbersome,
